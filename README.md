## Sample Images

A simple terminal setup with reduced opacity to allow for the blur effect from Hyprland.

<summary>Neovim</summary>

My setup of [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is inspired from a great video by [Sindo](https://github.com/JazzyGrim) which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V070Zmvx9AM&t=1054s). My goal was to make it a minimal setup for Rust development and potentially web development in the future.

<summary>Waybar</summary>

I prefer [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/)'s minimalistic status bar and have tried to replicate it with [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar). And whenever I do need more info, clicking on the icons which will reveal its expanded view.

<summary>Wofi</summary>

[Wofi](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Useful-Utilities/App-Launchers/#wofi) has been modified to have a more smooth look (rounded corners and dark color scheme) than what it ships with by default.
